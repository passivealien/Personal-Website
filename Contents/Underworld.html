  <h2>THE UNDERWORLD</h2>
  <p>In mythology, the Greek underworld is an otherworld where souls go after death. 
  The original Greek idea of afterlife is that, at the moment of death,
  the soul is separated from the corpse, taking on the shape of the former person, 
  and is transported to the entrance of the underworld.</p>

	<h3>A cavern near the ancient town of Tenarus.</h3>

		<p>
		Situated at the tip of the middle promontory of Peloponnese
		(known back then as Cape Tanaerum, and called Cape Matapan today),
		the cave exists to this very day.
		It was through this cave that Heracles dragged Cerberus out of
		Hades and Orpheus tried to bring Eurydice back to the world of the living.
		</p><br>
	<h3>The bottomless Alcyonian Lake at Lerna.</h3>
		<p>
		Guarded by the fearsome Hydra,
		the Alcyonian Lake was supposedly used by Dionysus to enter the Underworld and
		search for his mother Semele. Some even say that Hades abducted Persephone in its very vicinity.
		</p>
	<h3>The volcanic Lake Avernus</h3>
		<p>
		Located in southern Italy near the city of Naples,
		Avernus was sometimes used as a synonym for the Underworld in Roman times.
		It is through a cave found near this lake that Aeneas descends to the Underworld in Virgil’s “Aeneid.”

	<h3>Styx River</h3>
		<p>
		The river Styx is arguably more famous than the Acheron,
		and as a result many of the myths connected with the Acheron
		have been transplanted onto the Styx.
		The Styx was said to have circled the Underworld seven,
		or nine, time, having emerged first from the Acheron.
		Named as the River of Hate in Greek mythology, the River Styx
		was considered a river of punishment.
		The Styx did not have a Potamoi connected with it for instead
		there was a daughter of Oceanus, an Oceanid, called Styx who was
		associated with it. During the Titanomachy, the Oceanid Styx was
		the first ally themselves with the cause of Zeus during the Titanomachy,
		for which she was honoured. Thereafter, swearing upon the name of Styx,
		was part of an unbreakable oath, and those that did break the oath would
		drink from the Styx’s water, leaving them unable to speak for seven years.		
		</p><br>
	<h3>Acheron River</h3>
		<p>
		The river of sorrow and pain, black and deep.
		In antiquity, the River Acheron was the most prominent,
		and important, of the five rivers of the Underworld,
		and in some ancient texts it was said to be only slightly
		less important than the earth encircling river Oceanus.
		The River Acheron was perceived to be a physical barrier between
		the Underworld and the mortal world, for mortals could not cross
		it to enter the Underworld, and the dead could not cross it to escape.
		To this end, Hermes, Thanatos, or another Psychopomp,
		would bring the souls of the deceased to the bank of the Acheron,
		and the Charon, the ferryman, would transport the souls across the river on his skiff.
		Transport was dependent upon payment though, for during funeral rites,
		coins would be left in the eyes, or mouth, of the deceased.
		Those who could not pay would be left to wander aimlessly along
		the bank of the Acheron, and could possibly give rise to ghosts in
		the mortal realm. It was also along the far bank of the Acheron along which Cerberus,
		the triple headed dog, would patrol. The Acheron would be called the River of Pain,
		or Woe, in Greek mythology.		
		</p><br>
	<h3>Lethe River</h3>
		<p>
		The river of oblivion and forgetfulness,
		out of which the dead souls are obliged to drink so that they can forget their earthly
		lives in preparation for a possible reincarnation.
		The name of the Lethe is not as recognisable today as that of the Acheron or Styx,
		but in Greek mythology the River Lethe was the River of Forgetfulness.
		In the Greek Underworld, the River Lethe would flow across the plain of Lethe,
		and pass around the cave of Hypnos, thus the river was closely associated with the Greek god.
		Those souls who were to spend eternity in the greyness of the Asphodel
		Meadows would drink from the River Lethe forgetting their previous life.
		Drinking of the Lethe would become increasingly important when the idea of
		reincarnation became more prevalent in Ancient Greece.
		Nominally there was a Potamoi named Lethe, but there was also a daemon,
		a minor Underworld goddess called Lethe, who was the personification of Forgetfulness.
		</p><br>
	<h3>Phlegethon River</h3>
		<p>
		The river of fire, possibly leading to the depths of Tartarus,
		the deep abyss that is used as a dungeon of torment and
		suffering for the wicked and as the prison for the Titans.
		The River Phlegethon was the River of Fire in the Underworld,
		and thus this river was also known as Pyriphlegethon.
		The Phlegethon was a river associated with Tartarus,
		the deepest element of the Underworld, and was therefore,
		like the River Styx, considered to be a river of punishment.
		It was thought that some of those being punished in Tartarus would
		find themselves tortured in the boiling waters of the Phlegethon.
		There was also considered to be a Potamoi named Phlegethon,
		although the River god was not mentioned as an individual in surviving stories of Greek mythology.
		</p><br>
	<h3>Coctycus River</h3>
		<p>
		The river of lamentation and wailing.
		The fifth river of the Greek Underworld was the Cocytus,
		the River of Lamentation in Greek mythology.Like the Phlegethon,
		the River Cocytus was a river described as flowing through Tatarus,
		and was a river where the punishment of murderers was undertaken.
		In alter mythology it was said that it was along the banks of the River Cocytus,
		rather than the Acheron, that those lost souls who could not pay the fee of Charon were said to be found.
		In some tales though, the Cocytus is considered not to be a river but rather a swamp or a marsh.

	<h3>Elysium</h3>
		<p>
		Tartarus was both a primordial deity that existed before the Olympians,
		as well as a name to describe a region of the Underworld.
		As a god, he was third in rank after Chaos and Gaea, preceding Eros.
		As a place, it was far below than where Hades resided and it
		was used as the most horrible prison. Some accounts say that the distance between
		Tartarus and Hades was the same as between the earth and the heaven.
		Although the kingdom of Hades was the place of the dead,
		Tartarus was where ferocious monsters and horrible criminals were banished,
		' or where the gods imprisoned their rivals after a war. The three judges of
		the Underworld, Rhadamanthus, Aeacus and Minos, decided who would go to the realm
		of Hades and who would be banished to Tartarus.
		Moreover, Cronus, the king of the Titans, imprisoned the Cyclopes and the
		Hecatonchires in Tartarus, but Zeus released them in order to help him defeat the Titans.
		When the Titanomachy ended in favour of the Olympians, Zeus banished many of the Titans to Tartarus.
		</p><br>
	<h3>The Asphodel Meadows</h3>
		<p>
		Is a section of the Ancient Greek underworld where indifferent and
		ordinary souls were sent to live after death. Hades,
		the Greek name for the underworld (also the name of the Greek god of the Underworld,
		synonymous with the Roman God Pluto) is divided into two main sections:
		Erebus and Tartarus. Erebus was where the dead first entered the underworld.
		Charon ferried the dead across the river Styx where they then went into Tartarus.
		Tartarus is the section of the underworld where the dead would spend all of
		eternity in the place where judgment would order them.
		</p><br>
	<h3>Tartarus</h3>
		<p>
		Also called Elysian Fields or Elysian Plain, in Greek mythology,
		originally the paradise to which heroes on whom the gods conferred immortality were sent.
		It probably was retained from Minoan religion. In Homer’s writings the Elysian
		Plain was a land of perfect happiness at the end of the Earth, on the banks of the Oceanus.
		A similar description was given by Hesiod of the Isles of the Blessed.
		In the earlier authors, only those specially favoured by the gods entered
		Elysium and were made immortal. By the time of Hesiod, however,
		Elysium was a place for the blessed dead, and, from Pindar on,
		entrance was gained by a righteous life. Later writers made it a particular part of Hades,
		as in Virgil, Aeneid, Book VI.

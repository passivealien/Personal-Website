	<h3>Hades' Background</h3>
		<p>
		Hades and his brothers Zeus and Poseidon defeated their father and the titans to end their reign, claiming rulership over the cosmos. 
		They agreed to split their rule with Zeus becoming god of the skies, Poseidon god of the sea and Hades god of the underworld.
		He was later known to the Greeks as Plouton, which the Romans pluralized to Pluto. 
		The god of the underworld was married to Persephone, the daughter of Demeter, 
		whom he obtained through deception after abducting her to the underworld and giving her the forbidden fruit pomegranate,
		forcing her to remain in the underworld with him for one third of each year.

	<h3>Hades' Consort</h3>
		<p>
		Persephone, Latin Proserpina or Proserpine, in Greek religion, daughter of Zeus, 
		the chief god, and Demeter, the goddess of agriculture; she was the wife of Hades, king of the underworld.
		Zeus therefore intervened, commanding Hades to release Persephone to her mother. Because Persephone had eaten a single pomegranate seed in the underworld, however, 
		she could not be completely freed but had to remain one-third of the year with Hades, and spent the other two-thirds with her mother. 
		The story that Persephone spent four months of each year in the underworld was no doubt meant to account for the barren appearance of Greek fields in full summer after harvest, 
		before their revival in the autumn rains, when they are plowed and sown.

	<h3>Hades' Parents</h3>
		<p>
		Rhea and Cronus had six children; Hestia, Hades, Demeter, Poseidon, Hera and Zeus.
		Cronus, afraid that he would be overthrown by his children just like he had done with his father, decided to swallow all of them. 
		However, he was tricked by Rhea, who managed to save Zeus from his father. 
		When Zeus grew up, he forced his father to disgorge his siblings and eventually overthrew him.

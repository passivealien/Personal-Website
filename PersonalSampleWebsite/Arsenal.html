	<h3>MYTH & CREATIONS</h3>
		<p>
		One ancient source that attributes a special helmet to the ruler of the underworld is the Bibliotheca,
		in which the Uranian Cyclops give Zeus the lightning bolt, Poseidon the trident,
		and a helmet to Hades in their war against the Titans.
		In classical mythology the helmet is regularly said to belong to the god of the underworld.
		Rabelais calls it the Helmet of Pluto, and Erasmus the Helmet of Orcus.
		The helmet becomes proverbial for those who conceal their true nature by a cunning device:
		"the helmet of Pluto, which maketh the politic man go invisible, is secrecy in the counsel, and celerity in the execution.		
		Hades has been known to lend the Helm to other gods such as Hermes during the Giant War, 
		and once to a demigod (Perseus) when he killed Medusa.
		The Helm of Darkness was created after the Cyclops were freed during the Titanomachy. 
		They were so grateful for being set free, they created weapons to aid the gods in the war. 
		For Hades, they created the Helm of Darkness. He used it in this war and kept it afterwards.
		</p>
	<h3>ATHENA, PERSEUS AND HERMES</h3>
		<p>
		Athena, the goddess of wisdom, battle, and handicrafts,
		wore the Cap of Invisibility in one instance during the Trojan War.
		She used it to become invisible to Ares when she aided Diomedes, 
		his enemy. Her assistance even enabled Diomedes to injure the god of war with a spear.
		Perseus Perseus was a demigod who the gods favoured.
		He received temporary gifts that would help him slay Medusa. From Hermes,
		he received Winged Sandals, from Athena, he received either a shield made 
		of mirror or a bronze shield that was polished so it would reflect, a sword 
		from Hephaestus, and the Helm of Darkness, from Hades. Perseus would use this 
		to sneak into the cave where Medusa lived. He would later return it, after the rescuing of his mother.
		Hermes borrowed and used the Helm of Invisibility in a battle with Hyppolitos, the giant.

		At a later stage, he became associated with his weapon of choice, the bident,
		a two-pronged fork modeled after Poseidonâ€™s trident. 
		As Plouton, he was sometimes shown with a cornucopia, the horn of plenty.
		In classical mythology, the bident is a weapon associated with Hades (Pluto), the ruler of the underworld.
